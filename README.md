Your aim is to create a new resource of your choice for example *Posts* for a Blog site or *Cars* for a Transport site.

Your site will need to have the following:-

- All the restful routes for your resource which should be working
- Your routes should be separated out into their own class
- It should include all the relevant ERB templates for the routes that render HTML
- At least two partials
- A layout template
- A new set of data in a static Model
- Links to navigate around the CRUD actions on your site so you dont need to navigate via the url
- Styling to make the site look good **(This will need some research on how to include your CSS)**

*Deliverables*

Our aim is to delivery working code. Work on little sections of functionality and only commit when something is working. This means you have always got something that is working in your last commit. You might not complete all the points above but what you do delivery will be working.

## Pleased
I am pleased that I picked up working with erb so quickly. Although still slightly unsure, I feel like with more practice I will become more fluent.

## Difficulties
Just that I wish to be more fluent in coding. There are still a lot I do not know about erb.
